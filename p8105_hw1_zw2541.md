Problem 1
=========

Create a data frame
-------------------

This data frame comprised of:

-   A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution
-   A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
-   A (length-10) character vector
-   A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
set.seed(1)
p1_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logical = c(vec_numeric > 2),
  vec_char = c("zhao", "qian", "sun", "li", "zhou", "wu", "zheng", "wang", "feng", "chen"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"))
)
```

take the mean of each variable in the dataframe
-----------------------------------------------

``` r
mean(p1_df$vec_numeric)
```

    ## [1] 2.757569

``` r
mean(p1_df$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(p1_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(p1_df$vec_char): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(p1_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(p1_df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Result: I successfully calculate the mean of numeric and logical variables, but I can't get the mean of character and factor variables.

Explanation: Since the numeric variable is a set of numbers, it is quite easy to calculate their mean. For the logical variable, the system recognize TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0, so it can calculate the mean of a set of number 1 and 0. However, the system can't calculate the mean of character and factor variables, because these two variables are a set of words instead of numbers.

convert variables from one type to another
------------------------------------------

The code chunk showed below will convert logical, character, and factor variables to numeric variable:

``` r
as.numeric(p1_df$vec_logical)
```

    ##  [1] 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0

``` r
as.numeric(p1_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(p1_df$vec_factor)
```

    ##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

For the logical variable, the as.numeric function converts TRUE to numeric value 1 and FALSE to numeric value 0. And this function can't convert character variable to numeric variable. And as.numeric function converts favtor variable to different value of numbers from 1 to 10.
